# sort


Sorting Algorithm

Create a directory in your /vagrant folder (while ssh'd into your Vagrant VM). Within that directory, clone your fork of this repo, which contains one ruby file sort.rb.

Spend the time necessary to read and fully understand what the code in sort.rb is doing. Google or discuss as necessary. Have an expectation of what will be output when you first run the code, then use the ruby command to run the sort.rb file from the terminal.

Task: Currently, the built-in Array#sort method is being used (line 3) to implement the logic for the sort method. As an exercise, instead of leveraging this built-in method, implement your own sort logic such that the resulting output from this ruby script stays the same. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm for different sorting algorithms. At a minimum implement Bubble Sort.

As an extension, benchmark the different implementations versus the built in array.sort. Read about Ruby's benchmark here
